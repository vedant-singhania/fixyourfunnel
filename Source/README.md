#Code Assessment

I chose to implement this project with Laravel (php) as my logic language, with a little bit of js and SQLite as my DB.

I chose to implement this in Laravel for a couple of reasons:

- There was a fair bit to get done for this project with limited time. I wanted to focus on implementing the core features instead of focusing on standard things like session management. 
- The assessment is based on building maintainable and reliable code. By choosing a well known and established framework like Laravel this code base would be both reliable, maintainable and predictable. 
- I know that one of your products is implemented in Laravel so I figured this would be a good opportunity to get familiar with it.

Things I’m not addressing in the project because there’s limited time and I can’t get all the things that I want done.
- JS based filtering and sorting: would ideally like to have the sort filters be Ajax based instead of being quick and dirty form buttons 
- Pagination: Ideally some sort of auto scrolling feature would be ideal
- Vue.js state workflow: Laravel came configured with Vue JS. It would be ideal to implement the views with Vue components

TO RUN:

- Download the moments folder
- Open Terminal and navigate to moments folder
- run 'php artisan serve'
- run 'php artisan db:seed' 
- Open browser and type 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'
